<p>Amy and Gen met in September 2006 
    while volunteering for Habitat for Humanity. Gen asked a mutual friend for Amyâ€™s number and the rest is history!

        Gen planned a picnic in the park just after sunset to watch the July 4th fireworks display. 
        He popped the question as fireworks burst overhead, and of course, Amy said yes! They celebrated with their families the next day with dinner and a champagne toast.
